## 👋 Initial Words 👋

Welcome to your **Entry Task** for the **Autumn School of Solana 2023**.

**The objectives of this task are to:**
- 📝 Evaluate your prior programming experience.
- 📝 Acquaint you with the task assignment process.

## 📚 Task Details 📚

Inside a GitHub repository, you will find a folder named **`src`**. Within this folder, there's a file named **`main.rs`** that contains **10 functions, each resembling a question**. Currently, each of these functions returns a character set to **`x`**.

### Your task is to `modify` these `characters` in accordance with the provided questions. Once you've made your changes, push them to the repository (main branch). Our team will then automatically evaluate your submitted answers. Please ensure you only push changes made inside the `main.rs` file.

#### 🟥 DO NOT alter any part of the source code other than the return values. Any unintended changes will be your responsibility.

### 👩‍💻 Technical SETUP 👩‍💻

This task is written in the **Rust programming language**. Familiarizing yourself with Rust will be beneficial since it is **the predominant programming language used on the `Solana Blockchain`**. However, for this task, intricate knowledge of Rust is **not mandatory** as you're merely required to change return values. If you wish, you can **install Rust** using the `link provided below` and get acquainted with its associated workflow.
